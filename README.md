# The Ruby AT Protocol SDK

This gem is a work in progress aimed at providing a Ruby SDK for the [AT Protocol](). It is not yet ready for use. The goal is to provide a low-level interface for the AT Protocol for a high level of control and flexibility, while eventually providing a higher-level interface for common flows like authenticating, creating text posts, or creating posts with media.

## Installation

Install the gem and add it to your application's Gemfile by executing:

```bash
bundle add atproto
```

Or, if you prefer, add it to your Gemfile manually:

```ruby
gem "atproto"
```

## Usage

TODO

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/rspec` or `bin/rake` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment with the gem.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bin/rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bin/rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
